%this function uses that quadratic-solver to return the roots of the

%2-tuple, with the first element of the return'd tuple using the
%positive square-root of the discriminant and the second element of
%the return'd tuple using the negative square-root of the
%discriminant.  It is assumed that the return'd roots are not complex.
